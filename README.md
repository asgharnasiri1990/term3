# My JavaScript Learning Diary

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to my **JavaScript learning branch** — a space where I’m uploading my exercises, notes, and small projects as I learn how to code in JavaScript.

## ✨ What This Branch Is About
I’m still a beginner, so this branch is kind of my **coding diary**.  
Here, I’ll post:
- 🧩 Practice exercises  
- 💡 Mini projects  
- 🧠 Little experiments and mistakes I learn from  
- 📘 Notes and progress updates

## 🎯 My Goal
To build a strong foundation in **JavaScript** by coding every day, exploring new concepts, and improving step by step.  

> “Small progress is still progress.”

## 🧰 Tech & Tools
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML / CSS (for web practice)
- Node.js (for backend stuff)
- Git & GitHub (to track my journey)

## 💬 Feel Free To
Browse through the code, leave comments, or share tips — I’m always open to learning new things!
